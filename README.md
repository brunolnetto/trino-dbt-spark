## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project implements a **Medallion Architecture** using multiple engines optimized for different workloads:

```
Source CSVs → dbt Seeds → Apache Iceberg (Bronze) → Spark (Silver) → PostgreSQL (Gold) → Metabase (BI)
```

### Technology Stack
- **dbt**: Data transformation framework and pipeline orchestration
- **Apache Spark**: Big data processing and transformations
- **Apache Iceberg**: ACID transactions and versioning for data lake
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage
- **PostgreSQL**: Analytics warehouse for BI
- **Metabase**: Business intelligence and visualization
- **Trino**: Distributed SQL query engine (optional for direct querying)

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Modern Data Architecture**: Medallion pattern implementation
- **Multi-Engine Processing**: Leveraging different tools for optimal performance
- **Data Lake Engineering**: Apache Iceberg, partitioning, and optimization
- **dbt Best Practices**: Multi-profile setups, testing, and incremental models
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Docker Compose orchestration
- **Data Quality**: Testing frameworks and monitoring
- **Production Patterns**: CI/CD, security, and governance

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+ (for dbt)
- Basic SQL knowledge
- 8GB+ RAM recommended

### Infrastructure Setup
```bash
make build  # Build all Docker containers
make up     # Start all services (wait 2-3 minutes for health checks)
```

### dbt Profile Configuration
Before running the data pipeline, you need to set up your dbt profiles:

```bash
cd ecom_analytics
cp profiles.yml.example profiles.yml
# Edit profiles.yml if needed (default configuration should work with Docker setup)
```

**Note**: The `profiles.yml` file contains connection credentials and is excluded from version control for security.

### Data Pipeline Execution

The data pipeline uses dbt seeds to load the initial data and then processes it through the medallion architecture layers:

```bash
cd ecom_analytics

# Complete pipeline execution (including data seeding)
make run_all

# Or run individual steps:
make seed            # Load source CSV data into warehouse
make run_bronze      # Transform data in Bronze layer
make run_external    # Set up external tables
make run_silver      # Transform Bronze → Silver
make run_gold        # Transform Silver → Gold

# For incremental processing (skip full refresh):
make run_all FULL_REFRESH=""
```

## 🏛️ Pipeline Architecture

### Data Flow
1. Source CSV files are loaded via dbt seeds into the data warehouse
2. Bronze layer captures the raw data in Iceberg format
3. Silver layer applies business transformations and data quality rules
4. Gold layer creates analytics-ready views in PostgreSQL
5. Metabase connects to PostgreSQL for visualization

### Data Quality
- Bronze: Raw data validation and type casting
- Silver: Business rules and referential integrity
- Gold: Aggregation and final validation
